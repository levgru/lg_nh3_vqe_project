This repository contains all code (Python) and documents related to my spring 2024 PHYS64 project at Harvey Mudd College.

Feel free to replicate any code, as much of it has been adapted for other sources given in comments where necessary.

This repository includes:
~ Jupyter Notebooks ~
1. hh-distance.ipynb -> finds the ground state energy of H2 at various intramolecular distances.
2. nh3_local.ipynb -> locally and noiselessly simulates NH3 symmetric dual minima potential (sdmp).
3. nh3_cloud.ipynb -> cloud computation on an IBM noisy simulator and the IBM Kyoto quantum computer for finding NH3 sdmp.
4. figures.ipynb -> plots all data from 1-3 and visualizes circuits involved.
~ Data ~
hh_local -> created by 1
local_nh3 -> created by 2
ibm_noisy_sim_energies -> created by 3
ibm_kyoto -> created by 3
